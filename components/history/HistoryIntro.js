        Calypso was created in Manchester in 1988 to provide families with
        quality sun care products at the right price. We believes everyone
        should be able to enjoy the benefits of the sun without any risk of sun
        damage. It has expanded over the years and is now sold in over thirty
        countries worldwide.
