          <strong>Weather Disruption</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, severe weather conditions can disrupt our couriers from
          time to time. This can affect the services we offer and will affect
          the usual guarantee of service levels that are offered by our
          couriers. Naturally, couriers will always put the safety of its
          drivers and ancillary staff first over performance targets. Couriers
          do make every effort to put in place contingency plans when there is
          adverse weather. However, delays and back logs do occur from time to
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          These circumstances are beyond the control of both Linco Care Ltd and
          its courier partners. When selecting shipping methods please be aware
          that no refunds will be given on Express Delivery (usually next
          working day) or other timed delivery services if the courier is unable
          to operate its normal services due to bad weather. Express Delivery
          Services will always take priority and are still the fastest way to
          receive items.
